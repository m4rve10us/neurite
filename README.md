Experiments in applied machine learning and generative models.

This repo includes:
- LLM prompt optimization workflows
- Lightweight training runs using open models
- Experiment tracking using Weights & Biases
- Dataset preprocessing pipelines

Iâ€™m particularly interested in interpretable model behavior, low-rank adaptation, and human-aligned outputs.

Goal: real contributions to open-source AI research.
